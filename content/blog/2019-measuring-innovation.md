***I’m going to be frank***. If you came to find a few golden egg metrics in bold, 30pt font that takes all the thinking out of your analytics strategy, this is not the place for you. There is not a cookie-cutter solution to measuring innovation, but we can certainly help you figure it out. 

## Creating the Framework
Innovation can take the form of many things, but when it comes to measurement, it’s all about alignment. While there are millions of ways to look at data and likely thousands of different (and fragmented) metrics to measure innovation within your organization, the question soon becomes why do I measure rather than how do I measure. 

> The crux of innovation measurement is to understand the project that measurement should solve for the organization and, based on that insight, to design and implement a useful and usable innovation measurement framework appropriate to the organization’s needs. - MIT Sloan Management Review
