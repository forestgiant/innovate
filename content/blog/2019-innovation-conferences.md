## Innovation-Adjacent Events
While not totally focused on innovation, the following conferences typically have innovation-based presentations and workshops. Perfect for folks interested in getting their feet wet first, especially if you lean heavily towards tech, music, or design. 

### [**CES**](https://www.ces.tech/)
